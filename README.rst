========================

This is a sample project for a friend.

You need to have pip installed.

If you have make installed, you can just run the make command to set everything up.  If you don't, you have to run:

    pip install requirements.txt

In order to run the test, you can use

    nosetests

In order to see the output from your tests run the tests without hiding stdout:

    nosetests --nocapture

I believe you can also use --pdb to drop into a debugger on exceptions.
