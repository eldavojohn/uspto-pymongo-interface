========================

This is a sample project for a friend.

In order to run the test, you can use

```bash
nosetests
```

In order to see the output from your tests run the tests without hiding stdout:

```bash
nosetests --nocapture
```

I believe you can also use --pdb to drop into a debugger on exceptions.
